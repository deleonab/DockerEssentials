### DOCKER CONTAINER NETWORKING
---
How containers share resources and send messages to one another
Three networks are created for Docker upon installation
1.  Bridge Network - This is the default network for containers to connect to. Each container in the network is assigned a unique IP address. This allows containers in the same network to communicate.

2. None Network - No IP address is assigned
